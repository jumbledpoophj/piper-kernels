# Piper Kernels

Reusable PyTorch inference operators and optimized kernels for the Piper ecosystem and
other consumers.

Piper Kernels requires Python 3.13 or newer.

The package owns operator semantics, portable PyTorch references, tensor subclasses,
and optimized backends. It deliberately does not know about model repositories,
checkpoint metadata, pipeline frameworks, or device-offloading policy.

## Operators

| Package | Role |
|---|---|
| `piper_kernels` | Public Piper Attention and SageAttention2++ forward operators |
| `piper_kernels.convrot` | ConvRot quantized tensors and linear operators; INT8 today, INT4 planned |
| `piper_kernels.attention` | Attention dispatch, portable references, and optimized backends |

## Triton setup

Install the optimized backends with `piper-kernels[triton]`, or include ConvRot's tensor
format with `piper-kernels[convrot,triton]`. The extra selects Triton 3.7 on each supported
platform: upstream `triton` on Linux and
[`triton-windows`](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton-windows) on 64-bit Windows.

Optimized Windows execution requires Windows 10 or 11, a supported NVIDIA GPU with a
current driver, and the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022. The
Windows wheel bundles its CUDA toolchain and TinyCC, so a separate CUDA toolkit or Visual
Studio install is not required for Piper's Triton kernels. The base package remains
portable and does not require either Triton distribution.

## ConvRot INT8

Quantize a dense weight, or wrap existing checkpoint storage without dequantizing it,
then use the resulting tensor as a normal linear weight:

```python
import torch

from piper_kernels.convrot import ConvRotInt8Tensor, convrot_linear

weight = ConvRotInt8Tensor.from_hp(dense_weight, group_size=256)
checkpoint_weight = ConvRotInt8Tensor.from_quantized(
    qdata,
    scale,
    group_size=256,
    logical_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
)
output = torch.nn.functional.linear(activation, weight, bias)

# Optionally fuse a raw [up | gate] SwiGLU input with ConvRot preparation.
mlp_output = convrot_linear(up_gate, weight, bias, input_activation="swiglu")

# In-place low-rank update with the standard Tensor.addmm_ contract.
weight.addmm_(lora_b, lora_a, alpha=lora_strength)

# Reproducible stochastic terminal-code selection for a quantized LoRA merge.
weight.addmm_(lora_b, lora_a, alpha=lora_strength, rounding_seed=seed)
```

`from_quantized(..., logical_dtype=...)` is the preferred checkpoint-storage factory.
`from_packed(..., dtype=...)` remains available for compatibility with the 0.1 API.

For a weight with shape `[out_features, in_features]`, the SwiGLU input has shape
`[..., 2 * in_features]` and the output has shape `[..., out_features]`.
`convrot_linear(..., input_activation="swiglu")` computes `up * silu(gate)` before the
linear. Its optimized preparation fusion is selected only for measured SM120
configurations with group size 256. Other supported configurations materialize SwiGLU,
then dispatch through the ordinary ConvRot linear path, which may still use an optimized
backend. Ordinary `torch.nn.functional.linear` calls remain unchanged and do not apply an
activation. Both linear entry points are inference-only and reject autograd inputs.

`addmm_` computes `weight = beta * weight + alpha * (mat1 @ mat2)` and requantizes
the result. It preserves the ConvRot tensor and quantized storage identities, allowing
offload integrations to keep their existing buffers. Repeated updates are lossy, so
reload a pristine base weight before changing or removing a previously merged adapter.
Passing an unsigned 64-bit `rounding_seed` stochastically selects one of the two adjacent
INT8 codes with probability proportional to distance, without changing the deterministic
row scales or consuming PyTorch's process-global random-number generator. Omitting the seed
retains nearest-integer rounding. This is an inference operation and does not support
autograd. Torch and Triton each replay for a fixed seed, device, and backend; their random
samples are not promised to match each other or different Triton versions byte-for-byte.

The operator selects its Triton implementation on supported CUDA devices and otherwise
uses the portable PyTorch reference. Install the tensor format and optimized backend with
`piper-kernels[convrot,triton]`. The base package does not require TorchAO or Triton, and
attention-only consumers do not inherit the TorchAO dependency.

## Piper Attention

Piper Attention is the package's key-scaled integer-PV attention algorithm:

```python
from piper_kernels import piper_attention

output = piper_attention(query, key, value, is_causal=False)
```

It follows FlashAttention's fused online-softmax structure and SageAttention's K
smoothing plus INT8 QK quantization. Its distinct PV path quantizes each V key row
with one signed-INT8 scale, folds those scales into nonnegative probabilities, and
uses `UINT8 x INT8 -> INT32` tensor-core products. The probability multiplier remains
FP32 on the generic path so every finite FP16 input scale is representable without a
conversion in the hot loop. The generic online-softmax state, denominator, and PV numerator
remain FP32; its numerator stays in UINT8 probability-code units during the recurrence, and
the common factor of 255 is removed once in the output epilogue.
The quality-gated SM89/D128 long-context specialization stores scale coordinates in FP16.
At 8K and 32K it reconstructs the probability multiplier from the already-loaded coordinate
and buffers both bounded PV numerator halves in FP16. At 128K it retains one FP32 half and one
FP16 half and keeps the probability multiplier in FP32. The non-causal path uses a two-stage
loop, while the causal path uses a measured three-stage loop. Its conservative
bit-linear log-scale bound avoids a second hot-loop metadata stream without saturating UINT8
probability codes. Magic-biased integer MMA accumulators also remove the two PV tiles' scalar
INT32-to-FP32 conversions. The 128K preparation path retains full-sequence K/V centering so the
faster hot loop preserves the production relative-SQNR gate across both single-head and
multi-head inputs.

For centered V, Piper Attention uses the exact identity

```text
softmax(QK) @ V = softmax(QK) @ (V - mean_sequence(V)) + mean_sequence(V)
```

For non-causal attention, it stores only the compact FP32
`[batch, head, feature]` mean, subtracts it while quantizing V, and restores it in the
attention epilogue. This improves signed-INT8 precision when V has a large feature bias
and preserves constant V exactly. Causal attention leaves V uncentered so per-row INT8
rounding cannot make an earlier output depend on future V rows. Both paths preserve the
original K/V sequence order.

Native mixed-sign MMA is selected on the supported NVIDIA backend through the packaged
stock-Triton extension. The integer-PV benchmark retains the exact affine identity
`u @ v = (u - 128) @ v + 128 * sum(v)` as a signed-INT8 correctness control; unsupported
production targets use the portable quantized reference instead. The public optimized
dispatch supports NVIDIA SM8x and consumer Blackwell SM12x, whose Triton lowering uses
the MMAv2 instruction rewritten by the packaged extension. Exact SM120 uses packed
four-code probability conversion for D64 and non-causal D128, while causal D128 retains
the faster stock conversion. SM89 and exact SM120 have measured schedules; other
supported targets use the generic schedule. Production plan selection depends on target, head
dimension, and causal mode, not sequence length. Hopper lowers the operation through
unsupported WGMMA and therefore uses the slow portable quantized reference. Native ROCm
mixed-sign lowering remains future work.

Aligned non-causal SM89 self-attention with D128 and sequence length at least 8K uses a
dedicated kernel and separate fused Q/K/V preprocessing kernel. The 128K causal specialization
reuses that split-PV recurrence, launches the longest CTAs first, and separates the mask-free
prefix from the two causal boundary tiles. The fused preprocessing reproduces the unfused
quantized tensors and metadata while leaving causal V uncentered. Production retains per-key V
scaling and probability rounding; shared-64-key V scaling and truncation remain offline
ablation choices because they do not clear the relative quality gate. Other shapes continue to
use the generic kernel.

Piper Attention is an independently developed Sage-derived design. The per-key
quantizer, centering identity, and online-softmax lineage are not claimed as novel in
isolation; the name identifies this package's selected combination and fused recurrence.

## SageAttention2++

The package provides an independently written, pure-Triton backend for the
canonical [SageAttention2++](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention) 8+8 algorithm:

```python
from piper_kernels import sage_attention_2pp

output = sage_attention_2pp(query, key, value, is_causal=False)
```

Inputs use `[batch, heads, sequence, head_dim]` layout and may be FP16 or BF16. The
optimized backend requires NVIDIA FP8 tensor cores with FP16 accumulation (SM89 or
newer); measured schedules currently cover consumer SM89 and SM120 GPUs, while other
SM12x targets retain grouped Q/K quantization with generic scheduling. It supports head
dimensions 64 and 128, equal query/KV head counts, arbitrary positive sequence lengths,
rectangular non-causal attention, strided sequence dimensions, and `torch.compile`. It
is inference-only and does not support autograd. Its production execution plans are also
sequence-length invariant.

This is SageAttention2++, not a Piper Attention-specific algorithm: K is smoothed, Q/K
are quantized to INT8 with the canonical architecture-specific granularity, V and the
online-softmax probabilities are quantized to E4M3, each 64-key P x V tile accumulates
in FP16, and tile results are buffered in FP32. All optimized device code is Triton;
the package contains no CUDA extension. Unsupported devices use the slow
portable quantized reference.

Install either optimized attention backend with `piper-kernels[triton]`. The official CUDA
SageAttention package is a revision-pinned, optional benchmark dependency only; it is
not imported by production code. See [benchmarks/README.md](benchmarks/README.md) for
the reproducible provider comparison.

## Dependency direction

Applications such as Piper consume this package. Integrations such as torch-offload may
optionally recognize its tensor types, but `piper-kernels` does not depend on either
project.

## Development

```shell
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run pyright
uv build
```

GPU tests use the `gpu` pytest marker. The pre-commit test hook hides CUDA so commits run
the portable suite; run `uv run pytest` directly to exercise installed GPU backends.

## Releases

Releases follow the compatibility and release policy in [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).
Distribution artifacts are built from version tags and published to PyPI by GitHub Actions
using Trusted Publishing; maintainers do not upload releases from local environments.
